    "Welcome! This notebook introduces you to evaluating AI agents using specialized evaluators for agentic workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. Cora is an agentic AI assistant that orchestrates multiple steps—understanding customer intent, calling product search tools, and generating informed responses. This notebook teaches you how to evaluate complex agentic workflows using specialized evaluators for intent resolution, tool call accuracy, and task adherence, ensuring Cora reliably delivers on customer requests throughout its multi-step reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Understood the unique challenges of evaluating AI agents\n",
    "- ✅ Used Intent Resolution, Tool Call Accuracy, and Task Adherence evaluators\n",
    "- ✅ Created evaluation data for different agent scenarios\n",
    "- ✅ Interpreted agent evaluation results\n",
    "- ✅ Applied both quality and safety evaluators to agentic workflows\n",

    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents involve complex multi-step workflows including:\n",
    "- **Intent Recognition** - Understanding what the user wants to accomplish\n",
    "- **Tool Selection & Usage** - Choosing and correctly using available tools\n",
    "- **Task Execution** - Following through on the assigned workflow\n",
    "- **Response Generation** - Providing helpful and accurate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry provides specialized agent evaluators:\n",
    "- **Intent Resolution** - Measures whether the agent correctly identifies user intent\n",
    "- **Tool Call Accuracy** - Measures whether the agent made correct function tool calls\n",
    "- **Task Adherence** - Measures whether the agent's response adheres to assigned tasks\n",

    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully learned how to evaluate AI agents using Azure AI Foundry's specialized evaluators. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent Resolution Evaluation** - Measured how well agents understand user intents\n",
    "2. **Tool Call Accuracy Assessment** - Evaluated correct tool selection and usage\n",
    "3. **Task Adherence Monitoring** - Ensured agents stay within their defined scope\n",
    "4. **Complex Agent Interactions** - Handled multi-step conversations and tool usage\n",
    "5. **Batch Evaluation Pipeline** - Created scalable evaluation workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights from Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent evaluators provide specialized metrics** for agentic workflows beyond simple query-response\n",
    "- **Binary pass/fail results** with detailed reasoning help identify specific improvement areas\n",
    "- **Tool evaluation** is crucial for agents that interact with external systems\n",
    "- **Task adherence** ensures agents maintain their intended purpose and boundaries\n",
    "- **Combining quality and safety evaluators** provides comprehensive agent assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Evaluation** - Set up automated evaluation pipelines for agent deployments\n",
    "2. **Threshold Monitoring** - Configure alerts when evaluation scores drop below acceptable levels\n",
    "3. **A/B Testing** - Compare different agent configurations using evaluation metrics\n",
    "4. **User Feedback Integration** - Combine automated evaluations with human feedback\n",
    "5. **Tool Coverage Testing** - Ensure all available tools are properly tested and evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** for building production agents\n",
    "- Implement **continuous evaluation** in your agent deployment pipeline  \n",
    "- Try the **Response Completeness Evaluator** for more comprehensive quality assessment\n",
    "- Set up **custom evaluators** for domain-specific agent requirements\n",
    "- Integrate with **Azure AI Foundry portal** for rich evaluation result visualization\n",
