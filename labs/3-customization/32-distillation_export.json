It must resemble the following:\n\n```\n{\n  \"steps\": [\n    { \n      \"description\": <one sentence describing your reasoning for Metric 1>\", \n      \"result\": <string representation of Metric 1's score> \n    },\n    { \n      \"description\": <one sentence describing your reasoning for Metric 2>\", \n      \"result\": <string representation of Metric 2's score> \n    }\n  ],\n  \"result\": <floating point value of the Final Score>\n}\n\n## General Guidance\nThe questions will be about paint products and related topics. Deep research is not required. Use common sense to determine if the answer is polite, helpful and factual. The responses should be concise and to the point.\n\n```\n",
