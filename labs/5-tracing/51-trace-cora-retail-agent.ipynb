    "# 🛍️ | Observing Zava AI Agents with OpenTelemetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, you'll learn how to instrument **Cora**, our AI-powered shopping assistant for Zava Hardware Store, with **OpenTelemetry** for comprehensive observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛒 Our Zava Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. Zava offers a wide range of products including paint, power tools, hand tools, hardware, electrical supplies, and plumbing materials. Cora helps customers find products, check inventory, and calculate personalized discounts based on their loyalty tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Built Cora using Azure OpenAI Agents with custom tools\n",
    "- ✅ Instrumented the agent with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing\n",
    "- ✅ Captured GenAI-compliant spans with semantic conventions\n",
    "- ✅ Monitored tool invocations and agent reasoning\n",
    "- ✅ Exported telemetry to Azure Monitor Application Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial teaches you how to observe AI agents in production:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenTelemetry Setup** - Configure tracing for GenAI applications\n",
    "2. **Agent Instrumentation** - Automatically capture agent operations\n",
    "3. **Custom Spans** - Create manual spans for business logic\n",
    "4. **Tool Monitoring** - Track function tool invocations\n",
    "5. **Azure Monitor Export** - Send traces to Application Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Azure AI Foundry project with deployed model\n",
    "- ✅ Application Insights connection string\n",
    "- ✅ Environment variables configured in `.env` file\n",
    "- ✅ Required packages installed (see next cell)\n",

    "## 📊 Step 13: View Traces in Azure Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've generated several traced customer sessions, let's see where to view them in Azure Monitor Application Insights!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to View Traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Azure Portal** → Your Application Insights resource\n",
    "2. **Go to \"Transaction search\"** or **\"Application map\"**\n",
    "3. **Filter by \"Dependency\" or \"Request\"** types\n",
    "4. **Look for operations like**:\n",
    "   - `customer_session_paint_inquiry`\n",
    "   - `customer_session_inventory_check`\n",
    "   - `customer_session_discount_inquiry`\n",
    "   - `customer_session_multi_turn`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll See:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each traced session will show:\n",
    "- **Duration** - How long the entire interaction took\n",
    "- **Dependencies** - OpenAI API calls with token usage\n",
    "- **Custom attributes** - Customer query, session type, response length\n",
    "- **Tool invocations** - Calls to get_product_info, check_inventory, calculate_discount\n",
    "- **End-to-end trace** - Complete flow from customer message to agent response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Queries in Application Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kusto\n",
    "// View all customer sessions\n",
    "traces\n",
    "| where operation_Name startswith \"customer_session\"\n",
    "| project timestamp, operation_Name, message, customDimensions\n",
    "| order by timestamp desc\n",
    "\n",
    "// View tool invocations\n",
    "dependencies\n",
    "| where type == \"gen_ai.client\"\n",
    "| extend toolName = tostring(customDimensions.[\"gen_ai.tool.name\"])\n",
    "| where isnotempty(toolName)\n",
    "| project timestamp, toolName, duration, customDimensions\n",
    "| order by timestamp desc\n",
    "\n",
    "// Analyze token usage\n",
    "dependencies\n",
    "| where type == \"gen_ai.client\"\n",
    "| extend tokensUsed = toint(customDimensions.[\"gen_ai.usage.output_tokens\"])\n",
    "| summarize TotalTokens = sum(tokensUsed), AvgTokens = avg(tokensUsed) by bin(timestamp, 5m)\n",

    "## 🎓 What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built and instrumented Cora with OpenTelemetry. Here's what you've mastered:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Key Skills Acquired:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenTelemetry Setup**\n",
    "   - Configured tracer providers for GenAI applications\n",
    "   - Set up Azure Monitor exporters for production telemetry\n",
    "   - Enabled GenAI semantic conventions for comprehensive capture\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Instrumentation**\n",
    "   - Automatically traced agent operations without code changes\n",
    "   - Captured message exchanges between user and agent\n",
    "   - Monitored model completions with token usage metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Spans**\n",
    "   - Created manual spans for business logic (customer sessions)\n",
    "   - Added custom attributes for filtering and analysis\n",
    "   - Structured traces for end-to-end observability\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Monitoring**\n",
    "   - Traced function tool invocations automatically\n",
    "   - Captured tool parameters and return values\n",
    "   - Monitored tool execution times and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Production Observability**\n",
    "   - Exported traces to Azure Monitor Application Insights\n",
    "   - Analyzed agent behavior through distributed tracing\n",
    "   - Identified performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore Azure Monitor**: View your traces in Application Insights\n",
    "- **Add More Tools**: Extend Cora with additional capabilities\n",
    "- **Performance Tuning**: Use traces to optimize agent response times\n",
    "- **Error Tracking**: Monitor and debug agent failures\n",
    "- **Custom Metrics**: Add business-specific metrics to spans\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Additional Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)\n",
    "- [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview)\n",
    "- [GenAI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/)\n",
