    "\n",
    "**Cora** is a customer service chatbot for **Zava** - a fictitious retailer of home improvement goods for DIY enthusiasts. To ensure Cora provides the best customer experience, you need to select the right foundation model. With multiple Azure OpenAI models available (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4), you need to evaluate which model delivers the best balance of quality, safety, and performance for your retail use case.\n",

    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have:\n",
    "- ✅ Configured multiple Azure OpenAI models for comparison\n",
    "- ✅ Loaded standardized test datasets for evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Run evaluations across models using built-in evaluators\n",
    "- ✅ Analyzed performance metrics (quality, safety, latency)\n",
